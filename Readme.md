## Quest Tracker Tweaks

This addon is going to be the home for any changes or bugfixes I make to the default Carbine QuestTracker for Wildsar.

Currently, the only tweak is to add an "Abandon" button to the tracker's rightclick popup menu, underneath the "Hide" button.

So far it doesn't seem to add any major bugs to the tracker that I can find, but it's hard to be sure because the Carbine tracker is already pretty buggy.
